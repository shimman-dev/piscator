Ahoy, fellow sailor! Set your sights on the `piscator` CLT, a trusty companion
for your coding odysseys. With `piscator` by your side, you'll navigate the vast
seas of GitHub with ease, harnessing the power of the command-line interface to
explore, capture, and conquer the realm of repositories.

As a seasoned sailor, you'll command the `piscator` vessel to cast its net
into the GitHub sea, deftly capturing the URLs of repositories from users,
organizations, or even yourself. With each cast, `piscator` will bring you a
bountiful haul of valuable code treasures, presenting them in a convenient
format for further exploration. But `piscator`'s abilities don't end there! With
the reel command, you'll transform those captured repositories into tangible
assets by creating dedicated directories and git repositories for each catch,
ready to be harnessed for your coding voyages.

With its intuitive commands, `piscator` empowers you to hoist the sails of
productivity and embark on coding adventures like never before. Whether you're
seeking to explore, collect, or reel in repositories, `piscator` will be your
loyal first mate, guiding you through the GitHub waters with precision and
efficiency. Embrace the spirit of the sailor, unleash the power of
`piscator`, and embark on a coding voyage that will leave a lasting mark on the
open seas of code.
